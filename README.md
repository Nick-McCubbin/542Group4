# World Cup Data Mining Project - BZAN 542
This repo is our world cup data mining project by using R for text classification, a common natural language processing (NLP) problem. The project was built for a group project in BZAN 542 - Data Mining Methods for Business Applications at the University of Tennessee in Spring 2022. It is being posted here as a reference and hopefully a springboard for future extensions and refinements.
